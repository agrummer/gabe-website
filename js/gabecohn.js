        "description": "To realize such a device, I hypothesize that bioimpedance spectroscopy can be used. Bioimpedance analysis has been widely used in consumer body composition scales for determining an estimate for a person's fat content. In clinical practice, these measurements have been shown to be accurate <i>assuming constant hydration level</i>. My hypothesis is that on the time-scale of minutes to hours, a person's body composition doesn't change significantly, and therefore variations in bioimpedance are due to changes in hydration. I have built custom analog circuitry to accurately perform bioimpedance spectroscopy, and am currently conducting experiments to test my hypothesis"

        "description": "SNUPI (<u>S</u>ensor <u>N</u>etwork <u>U</u>tilizing <u>P</u>owerline <u>I</u>nfrastructure) is an ultra-low-power wireless sensor network platform that leverages the power line infrastructure of the building and uses it as part of the communications channel. In a traditional wireless sensor network, data is communicated over the air between the sensor nodes and a base station, perhaps after making several hops between the nodes. Using this over-the-air wireless communication, the battery life is typically limited by the high transmit power required for wireless signals to reach the receiver. In contrast, SNUPI uses a <i>powerline-coupled</i> wireless channel rather than an <i>over-the-air</i> channel. In a SNUPI network, the base station receiver is plugged into the power line, and uses the entire power line network as its receiving antenna. Therefore, to communicate data to the base station, sensor nodes can wirelessly transmit at extremely low power in order for their wireless signals to couple in the near-field onto the nearest power line, and then travel through the power line infrastructure like a transmission line to the base station receiver. Since the transmit power is so low, SNUPI nodes can operate for decades on a single coin cell battery! In addition, these networks have whole-building range because the power lines reach to all locations within the building.<br/><br/>Since there are many indoor applications of home monitoring, security, and automation, my collaborators and I co-founded a startup company called <a href=\"http://www.snupi.com\">SNUPI Technologies</a> to commercialize this work. The startup company has grown rapidly, and is now offering its first consumer product: <a href=\"http://www.wally-home.com\">WallyHome</a>. WallyHome consists of many sensors that are distributed around the house to continuously monitor for water leaks and measure temperature and humidity in order to alert customers of leaks and potential mold within their homes. In the future, we will continue to produce more easy-to-install sensor products using the SNUPI platform that are geared toward smart applications including home safety, security, automation, and peace of mind.",

        "description": "Humantenna is an on-body sensing system that recognizes whole-body gestures using the human body as an antenna that receives the existing electromagnetic interference (EMI) or noise from the power lines and electronic devices in a building. Specifically, Humantenna uses changes that occur in the observed signal as the body moves to different poses. In addition to demonstrating the ability to recognize various whole-body gestures in real-time at 92.7% accuracy, Humantenna can robustly classify a person's location within a building among a small set of trained locations at 99.5% accuracy. This approach to sensing mobile, whole-body interaction requires no instrumentation to the environment, and only minimal instrumentation to the user.",

        "description": "Wearable sensor systems have been used in the ubiquitous computing community and elsewhere for applications such as activity and gesture recognition, health and wellness monitoring, and elder care. Although the power consumption of accelerometers has already been highly optimized, this work introduces a novel sensing approach which lowers the power requirement for motion sensing by orders of magnitude. We present an ultra-low-power method for passively sensing body motion using static electric fields by measuring the voltage at any single location on the body. We present the feasibility of using this sensing approach to infer the amount and type of body motion anywhere on the body and demonstrate an ultra-low-power motion detector used to wake up more power-hungry sensors. The sensing hardware consumes only 3.3 µW, and wake-up detection is done using an additional 3.3 µW (6.6 µW total).",

Discone and Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) antenna arrays were constructed and made operational. I conducted error calibration tests and created a full computer model of the new antenna array using the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC) modeling software. Phase errors due to transmission line effects were studied, as well as a detailed exploration of the effect of mutual coupling between antennas in the array. The computer model of the array was used to produce an interferometer that can give the likelihood of a scatter event at every position in the sky. Graphical representations of these data were created using MATLAB code that I wrote specifically for this purpose. This new method of interferometry can be considered a vast improvement over traditional interferometry, because it gives not only the position of maximum likelihood of a scatter event such as a meteor, but also a map of likelihood of the meteor location across the whole sky.",
